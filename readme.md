# Whanos Project

Welcome to the Whanos project, a comprehensive DevOps solution designed to automatically deploy applications using a combination of Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, and Kubernetes. This project is an embodiment of advanced DevOps practices, integrating various technologies to create a powerful deployment pipeline.

## Project Overview

Whanos is a powerful entity in the realm of DevOps, symbolizing the pinnacle of automation and efficiency. This project revolves around setting up an infrastructure that leverages Docker for containerization, Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery, Ansible for configuration management, and Kubernetes for orchestration. The goal is to enable automatic deployment of applications into a Kubernetes cluster, triggered by a push to a Git repository.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Deployment:** Streamlined process from code push to deployment.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Compatible with C, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Befunge.
- **Customizable Infrastructure:** Extensible and configurable to fit various deployment needs.
- **Containerization and Orchestration:** Leverages Docker and Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.
- **Continuous Integration:** Integrates with Jenkins for automated building and testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Whanos project, follow the instructions provided in the `docs/INSTALLATION.md` file. This document contains detailed steps on setting up the necessary environment, tools, and components to get your Whanos infrastructure up and running.

### Installation Guide

Please refer to the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for detailed instructions on how to install and configure all the components of the Whanos project.

### Prerequisites

- Access to a Kubernetes cluster
- Familiarity with Docker and containerization concepts
- Basic understanding of Jenkins and CI/CD pipelines
- Knowledge of Ansible for configuration management

## Usage

Once you have set up your Whanos infrastructure, you can start deploying applications by:

1. Pushing your code to a configured Git repository.
2. Ensuring your repository is Whanos-compatible based on the language-specific criteria.
3. Observing the automatic deployment process initiated by Jenkins.
